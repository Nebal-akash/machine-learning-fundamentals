# ML Basics ðŸš€

This repo contains my implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms while learning the basics.  
Each notebook includes explanations, visualizations, and code from scratch + scikit-learn.

## Contents
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- KNN
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machines
- Clustering (KMeans, Hierarchical)

## Tools
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Goal
To build a strong foundation in ML by coding algorithms and experimenting on small datasets.
