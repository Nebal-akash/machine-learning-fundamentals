# ML Basics ðŸš€

This repository contains my Google Colab notebook where I explore the fundamentals of machine learning.  
It includes step-by-step implementations, explanations, and experiments with core ML algorithms.

## ðŸ“˜ Notebook
[ðŸ‘‰ Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13A59OHYlx6OEGa5QQGuI8XFdU7r1bnEP?usp=sharing)

## ðŸ“‚ Contents
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machines
- Clustering (KMeans, Hierarchical)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest


## ðŸ›  Tools
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
To build a strong foundation in machine learning by coding algorithms, experimenting with datasets, and understanding the underlying concepts.
